For project 1, we have given you a new option on the lc2200-16 assembler.

    python lc220016-as --logisim myFile.s
    
This option will tell the script to print out a logisim compatible version of
your compiled code into a separate file.

To load this logisim compatible version of your assembled program, open the
new 'myFile.hex' file in a text editor, copy the contents, and paste
it into the logisim RAM unit (that you used to implement the memory) at address
0 (a black box will be around the top left entry of memory). To paste, simply
ctrl-v.
